# Analysis of Traffic violations in Maryland County

**_Abstract-_** The number of fatalities,
property damages, personal injuries, and
traffic violations has multiplication since the
increase in the production of vehicles. Much
chaos can be created with improper and
irresponsible usage of vehicles. Along with
the damage, many of the vehicles have been
charged for violating the traffic rules and
penalized for the same. In this article, we go
through the data collected from Maryland
County and mention various insights. A brief
literature review also shows the works that
have been done in similar areas of interest. A
time series model is built to forecast the
accident statistics in the future.
